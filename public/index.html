      <h1>Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind</h1>
      <p>In order for a set of sets S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, ... to partition a set A, two things must be true:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>No two sets S<sub>k</sub>, S<sub>j</sub> can share a common element.</li>
          <li>For every element of A, there is a set S<sub>k</sub> that contains that element.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For instance, if this red block is a set:</p>
      <div id="vor_1" class="voronoi-set"></div>
      <p>Then the following shows how it would look partitioned into 3 parts, color-coded green, yellow, and blue:</p>
      <div id="vor_2" class="voronoi-set"></div>
      <p>The idea of a partition is useful in many cases; for instance, we can say that two
      probabilistic events are DISJOINT if they partition the set of all outcomes.</p>
      <p>Given this definition, one could
      pose the following question: how many ways are there to break a set of <i>n</i> elements (an<i> n-set</i> ) into
      a partition of <i>k</i> non-empty sets (a <i>k-partition</i>)? You would not be the first to consider the question-
      that honor goes to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stirling_(mathematician)">James Stirling</a>,
      who first described such numbers in the 18th century.</p>

      <p>It turns out that there is a simple formula for the number of k-partitions of an n-set (abbreviated S(n,k)
      <blockquote>S(n,k) = S(n-1, k-1) + kS(n-1, k)</blockquote>
      Examples:</p>
      <p>To see why this is the case, first observe that if k=1, then S(n,k)=1. After all, there is only one way
      to partition a set into 1 part!</p>
      <div id="vor_3" class="voronoi-set"></div>
      <p>Following similar logic, note that if n=k, then S(n,k)=1; each partitioning set will contain
          just one element. For the next example, n=k=4.</p>
      <div id="vor_4" class="voronoi-set"></div>
      <p>Now, to show the recurrence relation, we consider the first element of a set A; in this case, the one furthest left. Now this
       element can be included in a set with other elements, or it can be on its own. If it IS on its own, then there are
      n-1 elements remaining to be partitioned into k-1 subsets- that is, there are S(n-1, k-1) distinct possibilities for the
      other sets that, together with the singleton set, will partition the set A. To illustrate this, take n=4, k=3. The
      first element is highlighted in yellow.</p>
      <div id="vor_5" class="voronoi-set"></div>
      <div id="vor_6" class="voronoi-set"></div>
      <p>These are both perfectly good 3-part partitions of a 4-element set, with the first element in its own set.</p>
      <p>Now, if the first is not alone, then it must be in a group with some other elements of the set. There are n-1 elements left,
      and they can form k subsets in S(n-1, k) different ways. Now, for each of these different partitioning schemes,
          we can insert the first element into each of the k subsets. We know there are S(n-1, k) such valid partitions,
          and multiplying by the k choices for inserting the first element, there are kS(n-1, k) total possibilities.</p>

      <p>To illustrate again with n=4, k=3: ignoring the first element, you can partition the remaining 3 elements in just one way.</p>
      <div id="vor_7" class="voronoi-set"></div>
      <p>Now there are k=3 ways to add it to another set: one for each subset we just found.</p>
      <div id="vor_8" class="voronoi-set"></div>
      <div id="vor_9" class="voronoi-set"></div>
      <div id="vor_10" class="voronoi-set"></div>

      <p>This is exactly what is expected: there are S(3,3)=1 ways to partition the remaining 3 elements, and k=3 ways to
      include the left-over first element. kS(n,k) = 3S(3,3) = 3, as expected.</p>



      <p>Now complete the argument, let's get a little bit meta.
      You will agree that the first element can either be by itself, or be with other elements.
      Formally, that means that the set of partitions with this element by itself, and the set of partitions where it is with other elements,
      partition the set of all possible partitions!</p>
      <p>This is great, because it means that we can just add up the number for each and get the total size of the set.
      We said that there were S(n-1, k-1) partitions where the first element was alone, and kS(n-1, k) where it was with others.
      Now by adding, we find that S(n,k)=S(n-1, k-1) + S(n-1, k).</p>

      <p>Naturally, such a recurrence relation lends itself to a tree-like structure. Here are a few examples that should
      make Stirling numbers a bit easier to visualize. Click on the nodes to compress them and mouse over to see
      what stirling number it represents.</p>
